                        <p class="post-excerpt">
                            Often, I've wondered if there's something wrong with me for being scatterbrained. A generalist by heart, a specialist by necessity. I know what I love, yet it seems like the world demands is for you to be carved, like a puzzle piece meant to fit a picture that may not even be your own. I've tried and resisted and tried and resisted, but what I guess I've come to is acceptance and realization. I am a stick in a river that is going to keep moving, and as long as I stay dense and interally strong, the curent will not break me. It will move, and I will move with it, and hopefully stay instact.

                        <p class="post-excerpt">
                           If I look back at all of the interview's that have not resulted in a follow-up or a return offer, I'd do a lot of looking back. And don't get me wrong, I've reflected on them, wondered what I could have done better, what about myself didn't match the criteria or the description or whatever the company wanted. What I've realized is this - you can't control the results. Yes, you can be perfect on paper, and answer questions to the tee, and be a great person, but rejection still happens. Reflect on the mistakes, but don't let it get to your head. Just keep going.

                        <h3 class="post-title">"I'm Never Doing CS"</h3>
                        <p class="post-excerpt">
                            I remember sitting in my Highschool Data Science class, declaring to the friend next to me - "when I'm in college I'm definitely not doing CS." I sucked at it - ROYALLY. Compared to the guys in my class, who gamed and vibe coded for sport, I'd look at the computer and see a jumbled mass of words, that seemed to have no meaning. But then I entered college and I realized that the people I found the most interesting were builders, and entrepreneurs, and so I decided I was going to do it. I was going to understand CS. The thing I've realized about myself, like most other people, is that we typically love knowing things. And that feeling of understanding something and exploring it fully is never consistent in CS - it's always growing faster than we are. So we have to embrace the uncertainty and realize that it just makes it all the more exciting, novel, and consistently pushes you. And what's life without a little challenge?

                        <h3 class="post-title">Why I didn't choose IB</h3>
                        <p class="post-excerpt">
                            As a New Yorker, I'm surrounded by Investment Bankers, like ALL the time. Some of my closest friends are chosing to pursue IB, and finance is something my family is very skilled at. To them, at one point, me being at Goldman Sacchs would have probably made them extremely happy. And maybe it would have made me happy. Not to say it's a walk in the park, because it isn't, like, at all. But, you study a book, you know it well, you network, you apply, you get in, and you work insane hours, all for a massive salary. But here's the thing - it just didn't feel right. The feeling of being in professional attire is incredible sometimes but the gust of energy that I feel when I create something is unlike anything I've felt in my life. Whether it's building in the technical sense, when I decided to launch a food publication and got a board, funding and writers together (check out HM Eats, It's pretty fire), or even just learning something in a field I know nothing about and expanding my scope, that's where I've realized I feel the most joy.

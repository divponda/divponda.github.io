                        <p class="post-excerpt">
                            The best solutions often aren't the most complex ones. After working on everything from embedded systems to financial tools, I've learned that the mark of good engineering isn't how many libraries you can stack together—it's how cleanly you can express your intent. Simple code is maintainable code, and maintainable code is what actually ships and scales.

                        <p class="post-excerpt">
                            Both poker and debugging are about working with incomplete information and making decisions under uncertainty. In poker, you learn to read patterns, manage risk, and know when to fold a losing hand. In debugging, you learn to trace through logic, isolate variables, and know when to rewrite instead of patch. The mental models are surprisingly similar.

                        <p class="post-excerpt">
                            At Oaklet, I learned that startup infrastructure isn't just about scaling—it's about building for unknown unknowns. You need systems that can evolve quickly without breaking, security that works from day one, and code that new team members can understand immediately. It's less about the latest tech stack and more about making smart architectural decisions that won't haunt you six months later.

                        <p class="post-excerpt">
                            Working with Arc24 opened my eyes to how engineering principles apply to financial systems. Both domains require thinking in terms of systems, risk management, and optimization under constraints. Whether you're designing a credit analysis tool or a distributed database, you're ultimately building reliable systems that people can trust with important decisions.

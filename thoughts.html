      <h3 class="post-title">Being in Your 20s is About Being Lost</h3>
      <p class="post-excerpt">
        I've often wondered if there's something wrong with me for being scatterbrained.
        A generalist by heart, a specialist by necessity. I know what I love, yet it seems
        like the world demands that you be carved into a puzzle piece meant to fit a picture
        that may not even be your own.
      </p>
      <p class="post-excerpt">
        I've tried and resisted and tried again, but what I’ve come to is acceptance and
        realization. I'm a stick in a river that’s going to keep moving—and as long as I
        stay dense and internally strong, the current won’t break me. But when the current stops, that split moment, that second, is my time to pivot. It will move, and
        I will move with it, hopefully still intact.

      <h3 class="post-title">The Art of Bombing an Interview</h3>
      <p class="post-excerpt">
        If I look back at all the interviews that didn’t lead to a follow-up or return offer,
        I’d be doing a lot of looking back. And don’t get me wrong because I’ve reflected. I’ve wondered
        what I could’ve done better, what about me didn’t match the criteria or company or team.
      </p>
      <p class="post-excerpt">
        What I’ve realized is this: you can’t control the result. You can be perfect on paper,
        answer every question, and still get rejected. Reflect on the mistakes, sure, but don’t
        let it get in your head. Just keep going.

   <article class="post-preview">
      <h3 class="post-title">"I'm Never Doing CS"</h3>
      <p class="post-excerpt">
        I remember sitting in my high school Data Science class, turning to a friend and saying,
        “When I’m in college, I’m definitely not doing CS.” I royally sucked at it. Compared to
        the guys in my class who gamed and “vibe coded” for fun, I looked at the screen and saw
        a jumbled mess of words that meant nothing.
      </p>
      <p class="post-excerpt">
        But then I got to college and realized the people I found most interesting were builders
        and entrepreneurs. So I decided to try. What I’ve realized about myself, and most people, is
        that we love the feeling of understanding something deeply. In CS, that moment of clarity
        is rare and fleeting because the field moves faster than we do. But that’s what makes it
        exciting. We have to embrace the uncertainty. It keeps us sharp. And what’s life without
        a little challenge?

      <h3 class="post-title">Why I Didn't Choose IB</h3>
      <p class="post-excerpt">
        As a New Yorker, I’m surrounded by people going into investment banking. Some of my
        closest friends are doing it. Finance runs deep in my family. And at one point, me
        ending up at Goldman Sachs probably would’ve made everyone proud.
      </p>
      <p class="post-excerpt">
        But something about it never felt right. There’s something exhilarating about building, 
        whether that’s engineering infrastructure, starting a food publication like HM Eats,
        or learning something totally new and running with it. That’s when I feel most alive.
        It wasn’t about chasing prestige. I just realized that creation excites me in a way
        structure never could.
